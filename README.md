# Note Taker Express.js Challenge

## Description
For this challenge I was tasked with creating an application to allow the client/end user to create, save, and delete notes.

This app uses Express.js on the back end and saves and retrieves user generated note data from a JSON file.

The front-end had already been created, so I was tasked with: building the back-end, connecting it to the front-end, and deploying the finished application to Heroku so that users don't have to download the repository to use the website.
